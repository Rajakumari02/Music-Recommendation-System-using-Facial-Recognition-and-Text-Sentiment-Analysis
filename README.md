# Music-Recommendation-System-using-Facial-Recognition-and-Text-Sentiment-Analysis
-->Designed a music recommender integrating text sentiment analysis and facial emotion recognition using Python and OpenCV â€¢ Achieved a 25% improvement in recommendation accuracy and boosted user engagement by 40% through advanced personalization algorithms.
-->Implemened a system to detect facial expressions in real-time using computer vision techniques, capturing emotions from webcam images
-->Utilized machine learning algorithms to recommend songs based on detected emotions, leveraging features like danceability and energy from a Spotify dataset.

Steps:
 1. Data Collection
 2. Installing libraries
 3. Importing Modules
 4. Data preprocessing
 5. Feature extraction
 6. Face Emotion Detection Model
 7. Text Based Emotion detection
 8. Recommending songs based on emotion detected
